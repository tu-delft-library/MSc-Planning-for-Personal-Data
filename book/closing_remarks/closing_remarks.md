Thank you for your participation in this pilot mini-module “Planning for Personal Data.” We would be thrilled to have your feedback on these materials so that we can continue to improve them. 

## Module Recap & Additional Resources

The goal of this mini-course was to help you learn concepts and processes related to working with personal data and to support you as you prepare the components of an HREC application. To learn about what to do in a wider variety of research situations, and to explore the topics in more depth, we recommend that you check out these additional resources:  

- [Self-paced Course: Personal Data & Human Subjects in Research](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/data-management/trainingen/trainingen-voor-onderzoekers-en/personal-data-human-subjects-in-research)
    - This is a longer self-paced course meant for researchers, PhD candidates, and MSc students. We recommend that you enroll if you are interested in going more into depth about how the GDPR shapes research, and more complex research scenarios involving personal data. 

- [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf)
    - This document has been designed for TU Delft researchers (and students that perform research). We recommend that you read through it if you are interested in learning how to manage a wide variety of complex research workflows.
