# Welcome to the mini-module "Planning for Personal Data."

During your thesis project, do you plan to collect or re-use any data that originated from humans? That means that you will be dealing with personal research data, and you must follow certain legal and ethical guidelines. This training is meant for you!  This module will support you during the planning phase of your thesis research. That way you can plan ahead to ensure that all personal data will be handled in a safe and ethical manner.  

## Learning Goals by section:

By participating in this module, you will learn to:  

| Section | Topics |
|---------|--------|
| Section I | Recognize personal data. Recognize types of data that carry increased risk. |
| Section II | Identify potential risks to human participants. Explain how to mitigate these risks. |
| Section III | Enact key components of TU Delft's Human Research Ethics Committee's application process. |

## Format of this mini-module

This mini-module is online and self-paced. It will take you about 20 minutes to go through the materials. The quizzes at the end of each section are optional. The quizzes will add a few extra minutes to the total time it takes to complete the module. The module has an open format, which means you can bookmark it and refer to the information in the future.  

## Scope:

Please note, these educational materials are meant to teach basic concepts and processes that are required at TU Delft in advance of working with personal research data. More complex cases, such as projects involving special categories of personal data, the ones conducted within large research consortia, or projects carried out abroad, are NOT covered in detail in this module. For these, we will provide links to more in-depth resources.
