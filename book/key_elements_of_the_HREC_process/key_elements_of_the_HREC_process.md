# Key elements of the HREC process

## Ethical Approval for Your Thesis Project

In this section, we will describe the steps required to obtain ethical approval for your thesis project. If you plan to work with any data related to humans, you must submit an application to the HREC, the Human Research Ethics Committee.  

You must obtain ethical approval from the HREC before you collect or work with any human research data. It's wise to get organised and plan your research methods as early as possible, since it will take time and effort to gather the components and documentation necessary for a complete HREC application. 

## What is the HREC?

The role of the HREC is to act as a review and advisory board for TU Delft researchers: the committee members review your application to check that your research project will be conducted ethically and responsibly. The HREC Office also provides resources to help researchers, such as [the informed consent template](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/informed-consent-templates-and-guide) linked in Section II of this module, and a Human Research Ethics Toolkit. The  HREC has also developed workshop materials to help researchers assess and mitigate risks to their participants.  

## Overview: Applying for HREC Approval

Let's start with a visual overview of the whole HREC application workflow. Then we'll zoom in to each component:

## Zooming in: Components of the HREC application

### Component #1: HREC checklist

In the HREC checklist, you will indicate potential risks involved in your research and describe the specific strategies that you will use to minimise these risks. You saw examples of risks and corresponding mitigations in Section II of this module. It is also good to know:  

- Your thesis supervisor is the "Responsible Researcher” on the HREC checklist. You are the "Corresponding Researcher.” 

- Your supervisor needs to sign the HREC checklist as the responsible researcher. 

- The HREC checklist must be completed thoughtfully and comprehensively. Your answers on the HREC checklist must line up with all the other documents you submit.

### Component #2: Your DMP

You'll be instructed to upload a copy of your Data Management Plan (DMP). A DMP describes the research process, from start to wrap-up of the project. As indicated in the flowchart, for the purposes of HREC, you must create your DMP in TU Delft's [DMP-Online](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/?perform_check=false) platform. Your DMP should provide a level of detail and description that helps someone with no knowledge of your research project to imagine your research method and/or experimental setup: what type of data you will collect, and what you will do with it. The more detailed and descriptive your documentation, the better!

**Examples of too-vague project description**

The study involves a survey on the how university students feel about the housing crisis in Randstad. The student stores the data securely during the research process. The data will be included in the thesis, which is made public at the end of the project.

**Examples of effective project description**

The study involves a survey on the how university students feel about the housing crisis in Randstad. An anonymous survey is distributed using QR codes on posters in four universities in the Randstad area. Microsoft Forms is used for the survey, and neither email addresses or IP-addresses are collected. Questions are asked as either multiple-choice or on a 5-point Likert Scale: information collected include age-range, university of study, current type of housing, as well as perceptions on the difficulty of finding housing and satisfaction with current housing. The survey data will be deleted from Microsoft Forms once it has been moved to the TU Delft OneDrive, used for primary storage. Only the student and supervisor have access to this storage solution. The data will be included in the body and appendix of the thesis, which is made publicly available in the TU Delft Repository.

### Component #3: Participant consent materials

You'll need to upload a copy of your informed consent letter or opening statement (refer back to [Section II](informed-consent-section) of the module for instructions/resources for drafting an informed consent statement).

### Additional required materials: Check for special circumstances!

The flowchart above applies to general research scenarios. Your thesis project may involve special circumstances that require additional permissions and documentation. Click on the accordion below to read more about each.

```{dropdown} Internships

For more information about Graduation Agreements or "Internship Agreements" see page 42 of the [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf).

To read more about sharing data with or receiving data from external collaborators, see information about Data Transfer or Data Processing Agreements on page 37 of the [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf).

To read about agreements for intellectual property rights, see page 33 of the [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf).
```
```{dropdown} Research activities conducted outside of the Netherlands

Students considering travelling abroad for their Master's project must attend a mandatory Travel Safety training session. See more details on page 53 of the [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf).
```
```{dropdown} Special Categories of Personal Data

Working with special categories of personal data requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). TU Delft has developed a template with a corresponding manual. For more information, see page 48 of the [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf).
```
```{dropdown} Medical data or development of medical prototypes

To read about requirements for medical data or the development of medical prototypes, see pages 46 and 49 of the [PRDW+](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/TU%20Delph%20PRDW__v1.1_19.02.25.pdf).

## Importance of Careful Planning

By planning carefully and gathering all the necessary documents for the HREC process, you can save a lot of time and effort If key components of your HREC application are missing, you may be required to revise and resubmit the application, which could delay the start of your research. Here are some examples of "holes” that could trigger resubmission:  

- You didn't include copies of the required documents like your Informed Consent form.  

- The descriptions of your planned research methods are unclear or incomplete in your DMP.  

- Your research indicates increased risk to participants without adequate mitigations or rationale (ex: processing special categories of personal data, vulnerable data subjects). 

- The risk assessment checklist does not demonstrate that you've adequately assessed or appropriately mitigated risks to your human research participants.  

- There is misalignment among the documents included in the application. For example, the DMP says: “Pseudonymised dataset will be archived under restricted access," but the consent form states, “Your anonymised data will be made openly available.” 

- For internships, issing agreements with external parties, such as Data Processing Agreement for sharing personal data with external researchers.  

- Intention to conduct research in an area with orange or red travel advice by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

## Get Help! Seeking Advice and Support

**Thesis Supervisor**
- Lean on your supervisor for research experience and advice!
- They are the responsible researcher, and should be consulted about the entire ethical application.

**Data Stewards**
- The TU Delft data stewards can provide advise and feedback and help you to navigate through the workflow. For example, the data stewards can:  
    - Provide information about working with personal data. 
    - Provide feedback on your data management plan and consent form.  
    - Advise on possible additional steps/documentation needed when working with special categories of personal data or more complex research scenarios. 
    - Recommend secure data storage, backup and sharing options .  
    - Shed light on whether particular risks are relevant to your study and how to mitigate those.
