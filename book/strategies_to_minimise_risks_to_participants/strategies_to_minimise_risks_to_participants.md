# II. Strategies to Minimise Risks

## Research Ethics: Minimising Risks

**Conducting ethical research means avoiding potential harm to participants** from the moment you start designing your research project for as long as the data is stored. In this section, we'll focus on strategies to minimise such risks.   

Here are three examples of risks related to personal data. Turn the cards to see potential mitigations for each:

## General Risk Minimisation Strategies

Here, we look at three common risk mitigation strategies.

### Risk Reduction Strategy #1: Obtain Consent from Participants

(informed-consent-section)=
#### Direct Consent through Informed Consent

An informed consent form (ICF) is standard practice used to mitigate risks for interviews, surveys, focus groups, ethnographic studies, observations, experiments with human participants, etc. An ICF is an agreement between the researcher (you) and the research participant (people from whom you plan to collect data).  

The general structure of an ICF is as follows:  

- **Intro**: explains who you are and research partners in the study.
- **The Topic**: explains what you are studying and what you want to find out.
- **The Protocol**: explains what you are asking people to do and potential risks involved.
- **The Data**: describes what type(s) of data will be collected from participants.
- **Participants’ Rights**: explains that participants can exit the study at any time with no negative consequences.
- **Researcher's Contact Information**: gives participants a way to contact you if they have concerns or complaints.
- **Participant's Signature**: Participants sign to indicate they have read and understand the details in the ICF (can include the date).

#### Templates and Examples of ICFs: 

**You'll need to adapt these templates and examples to craft an ICF that fits your specific project.**

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
<b>*Please note:</b> This example includes sections stating that not only will the data be used in the thesis (which is published in the TU Delft Repository), but the anonymised and aggregated dataset will be shared in a data repository (4TU.ResearchData) as well. Sharing to a data repository is optional for students. We've included it in this example, because these sentences/consent points can be easily omitted (and it is important to get right if you do want to do this).

```{note}
An ICF is only effective if it clearly informs your participants: **people need to understand exactly what they're signing up for** and how you will minimise the potential risks. Therefore it should clearly explain the purpose of the study, how the data will be used and stored, who will have access to it, and what rights participants have (e.g., to withdraw at any time). **A well-prepared ICF builds trust, ensures ethical compliance, and protects both you and the participants.**
```

#### Implied Consent via an Opening Statement

If your survey will not collect directly identifiable details like participants’ names/contact information, an opening statement is recommended instead of a signed ICF to minimise the collection of directly identifiable personal data. An opening statement functions like a cover page to the survey. Just like an informed consent form, an opening statement should clearly summarize the purpose of the study, how the data will be used and processed, how the data will be stored and protected, and for how long.

The main difference is that participants do not give their name or signature. Instead, they are asked to imply their consent by clicking onwards to the start of the survey.

#### What if informed consent cannot be obtained?

If you cannot obtain informed consent, for instance, if you plan to re-use data from humans from social media, your supervisor will need to reach out to the TU Delft Privacy Team regarding the lawful basis (a valid reason to colect/re-use the data) and required measures.

### Risk Reduction Strategy #2: Anonymising & Pseudonymising Personal Data

**Anonymisation** is the process of modifying/erasing all personal data that may be traceable to a unique person in such a way that it is no longer possible to link it to a specific research participant. Anonymisation is **permanent and irreversible**. After a data set is anonymised it's no longer considered personal data because the information cannot be traced back to any single participant. Anonymisation makes it possible to store, process, and share without exposing people's personal data. 

```{admonition} Example 1: Anonymisation
:class: tip
In a large-scale survey on students' learning experiences across universities, full anonymisation means removing all personal data that could be linked back to an individual. For example, deleting student ID numbers, email addresses, and names of supervisors mentioned in responses.
```

Best practice is not to collect such personal details in the first place if they are not essential to address research questions (note: it may be necessary to collect names for the purposes of informed consent). But if these details have already been collected, researchers must ensure they are removed so the dataset can no longer be traced back to a specific person. 

```{admonition} Example 2: Anonymisation
:class: tip
A dataset contains interview transcripts with quotes like “As the only female professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering, I often feel….” This clearly identifies the participant. After anonymisation, the transcript is changed to “As a professor in my department, I often feel….” The reference to a gender and specific department is removed so the statement can no longer be traced back to one individual.
```

**Pseudonymisation** means that a researcher replaces certain personal data with anonymous identifiers such as number or letter combinations in a way that the personal data can't point to a specific subject without additional information. As part of pseudonymisation the researcher also **aggregates** the data, replacing specific details with more general categories. 

```{admonition} Example 1: Pseudonymisation
:class: tip
A researcher recorded participants’ last names. To pseudonymise the data, she replaces the last names with number codes and creates a key showing the code for each name. This pseudonymised data can be shared with restricted access, with participants' consent. The researcher must then store the key in a secure location and control access to it since the key allows for reidentification of participants.
```

This example illustrates that pseudonymisation is **reversible** (with the key). This is why **pseudonymised data is still considered personal data.**

```{admonition} Example 2: Pseudonymisation
:class: tip
In the large-scale study of students’ learning experiences mentioned earlier, the researchers are able to adjust identifiers without impacting their research question. The researchers **aggregate** detailed programme codes by grouping the participants into faculty/discipline, and also aggregate individual campus and city names into broader regions. The researchers **pseudonymise** the student IDs by replacing the IDs with random codes, ensuring that the linkage file (code key) is stored separately in a secure location, with access restricted to the minimum necessary project collaborators.
```

Anonymisation and pseudonymisation are **time-intensive processes**. We recommend that you design your study to collect only the personal data that you absolutely need to answer your research question(s). Right now, in the planning phase of your research, you must establish whether you will anonymise or pseudonymise participants’ personal data. On your Informed Consent form and in your ethics application you must describe how/which personal data you will anonymise or pseudonymise.

### Risk Reduction Strategy #3: Secure Storage

Secure data storage practices are a key risk mitigation strategy. Secure storage protects you against data loss and protects personal data from security breaches or leaks. You must choose a storage solution appropriate to the size and the sensitivity of the data, and preferably a platform that stores data within the EU. If applicable, you might also consider which storage options allow you to share the data securely with collaborators. File sharing only applies if you are working with data that can legally and ethically be shared.  

Here is an overview of recommended storage platforms for master’s students at TU Delft:

- Commercial third party cloud storage such as Dropbox and Google Drive: Cloud applications such as Google and Dropbox store data outside the EU. They are thus not approved by TU Delft, especially for storing personal research data.

- Portable drives such as hard drives and thumb drives: it’s too easy for these to get damaged, lost or fall into the wrong hands.   

- Floating on the desktop of your personal computer: this puts any personal data at risk (and all your work could get lost if stolen or broken).  

#### Best Practices for Storage 

- It's important to discuss the end-of-life of the data with your supervisor: How long should the data be stored? Where? Who will have access to it?
  
- Whenever possible, directly identifiable details should be stored separately from indirectly identifiable information in order to decrease the potential for reidentification of participants.
  
    - For example: informed consent forms with participants’ names and signatures should be stored in a secure folder separate from the other raw data. The same rule applies to the keys for pseudonymised data. 

- Institutional TU Delft storage solutions should be used.  

- Your supervisor should have access to the data.
